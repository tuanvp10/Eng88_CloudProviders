# Top Cloud Providers

## Amazon Web Services
AWS was the early leader in public cloud computing and has become a major player in AI, database, machine learning and serverless deployments. 

 One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.

Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, and Australia.

## Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service from Microsoft. Azure offers a range of software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) options for deploying applications and services on Microsoft-managed data center infrastructure. Azure’s 50 operating regions are more than any other cloud provider.

Microsoft Azure has more than a hundred services to help you quickly solve your toughest challenges. Azure’s agility and built-in Development Operations (DevOps) allow you to iterate quickly and deliver code using an end-to-end cloud development platform. Whatever language you utilize, whether Microsoft Azure’s Visual Studio Team Services or another open-source tool like Chef or Jenkins, you will be able to debug faster and easier than ever before.

Microsoft Azure supports private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud deployments. Azure’s robust Information Security (InfoSec) services provide general, storage, database, and networking security, identity and access management, backup and Disaster Recover (DR).

## Google Cloud Platform
Google Cloud (also known as Google Cloud Platform or GCP) is a provider of computing resources for developing, deploying, and operating applications on the Web. Although its cloud infrastructure does serve as the host for applications such as Google Workplace (formerly G Suite, and before that Google Apps), GCP is mainly a service for building and maintaining original applications, which may then be published via the Web from its hyperscale data center facilities.

When you run a Web site, an application, or a service on GCP, Google keeps track of all of the resources it uses -- specifically, how much processing power, data storage, database queries, and network connectivity it consumes. Rather than lease a server or a DNS address by the month (which is what you would do with an ordinary Web site provider), you pay for each of these resources on a per-minute or even per-second basis, with discounts that apply when your services are used heavily by your customers on the Web.

From the perspective of corporate parent Alphabet, GCP is a separate business unit, addressing the business need for enterprises and, in some cases, individuals to deploy software that is usable via Web browsers or through Web apps. GCP leases software, along with the resources needed to support that software and the tools with which such software is developed, on a pay-as-you-go basis.
